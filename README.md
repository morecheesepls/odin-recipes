Odin Project Lesson

# Introduction
This will be a basic recipe page using the skills I've learned thus far in the Odin Project. For example, setting up the HTML boiler-plate, utilizing HTML tags and attributes, sorted and unsorted lists, as well as basic formatting such as <strong> and <em>. I will also practice adding, committing and pushing my local repo changes to my GitHub repo with good commit messages.
